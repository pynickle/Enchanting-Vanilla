# Enchanting Vanilla

A vanilla extension mod

## **Functions implemented:**

### **1.** *Villager Attraction*
* Villagers can be attracted by the player holding an emerald in the main hand and an ominous banner in the offhand.

### **2.** *Invisible Item Frame*
* You can use a Splash Invisibility Potion on an item frame to make it invisible, as well as a Splash Water Bottle to de-invisible it.
* Item frames are only invisible when items are placed on them.

### **3.** *Blocks On Lily Pad*
* Now you can place blocks above the lily pads, which works by turning the block underneath into waterlogged lily pad.
* When the block above is removed, the lily pad will revert to its vanilla version.

### **4.** *Slime Chunk Detecting*
* You can right-click a frog with a bucket to get a frog bucket.
* When you come to the Slime chunk with a frog bucket in your inventory, the frog bucket will be animated.

### **5.** *More Compostable Items*
* You can now compost even more items, which include rotten flesh, dead bush, grass blocks and more.
* Specific information can be viewed in JEI or EMI.

### **6.** *Painting Switching*
* You can now right-click on a painting to quickly switch between paintings.
* This is compatible with the Fast Paintings mod.

### **7.** *Cut Vine*
* Now you can right-click on the vine to convert it and the vines below it into cut vines, which will not grow.

### **8.** *Stop Growing*
* Now you can right-click on bamboo and sugar cane with shears to stop them growing.

### **9.** *Compress Slime Block*
* Now you can make it compress into a compressed Slime block by placing an anvil on top of two consecutive slime blocks above and below.
* It's more sticky, and you can bounce higher and higher on it

### **10.** *Torch Hit*
* You can attack creatures with torches or soul torches to give them a chance to catch fire, compatible with Soul fire'd.
* In the config file you can configure creature catching fire time and probability, etc., and you can also add torches from other mods (some of which have already been added).

### **11.** *Slabs To Blocks*
* Add recipes for all slabs to blocks.

### **12.** *Sponge Place*
* You can now place a sponge directly on the water without having to place a cube next to it first.

### **13.** *Sponge Campfire*
* Now you can use campfire drying sponges.

### **14.** *Sculk Compass(Biome Finder)*
* You have a chance to find a damaged sculk compass in an Ancient City chest, use Echo Shards and Amethyst to repair it.
* You can swipe suspicious blocks for a chance to get different types of biome crystals.
* You can manually convert these biome crystal types (refer to tooltip).
* You can craft a biome crystal that corresponds to a biome.
* Place the biome crystal in your offhand and the sculk compass in your main hand, long press to use it and the compass will point to the biome corresponding to the biome crystal.
* There is a 1% chance that it will explode and lose your biome crystal, and the sculk compass will also be destroyed.
* If not damaged, the biome crystal returns to the unbound biome state and you can craft it again.
* Throw the sculk compass into Soulfire to remove its bindings.
* The sculk compass will randomly spin if no biome is found or if it is unbound.

### **15.** *Farmland Trampling Prevention*
* Now when you have a slow falling effect, you won't be trampling farmland.
