# Enchanting Vanilla

A vanilla extension mod

## **Functions implemented:**
* Villagers can be attracted by the player holding an emerald in the main hand and an ominous banner in the off hand
* You can use a Splash Shape Invisibility Potion on an item frame to make it invisible, as well as a Splash Shape Water Bottle to de-invisible it. Item frames are only invisible when items are placed on them.
* Now you can place blocks above the lily pads, which works by turning the block underneath into waterlogged lily pad
