# Enchanting Vanilla

A vanilla extension mod

## **Functions implemented:**

### **1.** *Villager Attraction*
* Villagers can be attracted by the player holding an emerald in the main hand and an ominous banner in the offhand.

### **2.** *Invisible Item Frame*
* You can use a Splash Shape Invisibility Potion on an item frame to make it invisible, as well as a Splash Shape Water Bottle to de-invisible it.
* Item frames are only invisible when items are placed on them.

### **3.** *Blocks On Lily Pad*
* Now you can place blocks above the lily pads, which works by turning the block underneath into waterlogged lily pad.
* When the block above is removed, the lily pad will revert to its vanilla version.

### **4.** *Slime Chunk Detecting*
* You can right-click a frog with a bucket to get a frog bucket.
* When you come to the Slime chunk with a frog bucket in your inventory, the frog bucket will be animated.

### **5.** *More Compostable Items*
* You can now compost even more items, which include rotten flesh, dead bush, grass blocks and more.
* Specific information can be viewed in JEI or EMI.

### **6.** *Painting Switching*
* You can now right-click on a painting to quickly switch between paintings.
* This is compatible with the Fast Paintings mod.

### **7.** *Cut Vine*
* Now you can right-click on the vine to convert it and the vines below it into cut vines, which will not grow.

### **8.** *Stop Growing*
* Now you can right-click on bamboo and sugar cane with shears to stop them growing.

### **9.** *Compress Slime Block*
* Now you can make it compress into a compressed Slime block by placing an anvil on top of two consecutive slime blocks above and below.
* It's more sticky and you can bounce higher and higher on it
